### HeyðŸ¤Ÿ

I've been studying data engineering for 2 years now. Also I have a background of web, database and game development. I like to rewrite standard libraries, expanding their functionality. Fluent in python =)   


#### Main libraries

`ML` - constantly updated library to make life easier for ml programmers   
`Linux` - a set of basic Linux commands necessary for comfortable work   
`Algorithms` - implementation of basic algorithms such as search, sorting and comparison
